DESCRIPTION

LVDS (Low-Voltage Differential Signaling) is a common video interface found
in many applications.  An LVDS interface that was originally known as FPD-Link
from National was used back in the early 1990s.  National invented both FPD-Link
and LVDS.  Eventually TI second sourced it with their FlatLink family.  This
standard evolved to Open LDI (LVDS Display Interface) targeted at both Notebook
and Monitor displays.  It is a reduced pin count interface (compared to parallel
RGB888) and uses LVDS levels for lower EMI.  This interface is found as a common
video output on many sources, and is also used as inputs to many displays. 
Intel FPGAs and CPLDs can not only be used to economically interface with
OpenLDI devices, but to process the video data and perform countless other
system functions as well.  These interface blocks are designed to connect
seamlessly with the Video and Image Processing Suite (VIP Suite) Clocked Video
Input II (CVI) and Clocked Video Output II (CVO) components.


DOCUMENTATION

Official documentation for the LVDS Video Interface IntelÂ® FPGA IP can be
found within the "docs" folder of the repository.


CONTENTS

The following objects appear in the top level directory of this project.

./docs
  This directory contains documentation for the IP.

./quartus
  This directory contains a basic example design which uses the LVDS Video
  Interface.  Its purpose is to demonstrate the interconnect to/from the
  Intel VIP clocked video components.

./source
  This directory contains all of the design files for the Multi-Rail Power
  Sequencer and Monitor design.


USAGE

Please refer to the user documentation, as well as the example design in the
./quartus directory for usage.  The source directory can either be contained
within a stand-alone project (as is done in the project archive), or copied
to a directory of library components and referenced by the Quartus project.
The "LVDS_VideoIP.doc" document contains details on how to parameterize,
simulate, and compile the design.


REQUIREMENTS

This project development began in the Quartus Prime 15.0 tools environment but
it should work fine in future tools releases as well.  Because this IP leverages
specific LVDS primitives, it has been developed to support the following device
families: Stratix V, Arria 10, Arria V, Arria V GZ, Cyclone IV, Cyclone IV E,
Cyclone V, MAX 10.
